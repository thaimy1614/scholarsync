# 🚀 ScholarSync

**A microservices-based platform for school management.**

## 📖 Overview

ScholarSync is a comprehensive school management system built using a microservices architecture.  It aims to streamline various administrative tasks, providing a centralized platform for managing users, attendance, resources, timetables, and more.  The system is designed for educational institutions seeking a flexible and scalable solution.  Each service is independently deployable and scalable, allowing for granular control and optimized resource utilization.

## ✨ Features

- **User Management:** Manage student, teacher, and administrative user accounts.
- **Attendance Tracking:** Record and analyze student attendance data.
- **Resource Management:**  Manage and track school resources (e.g., textbooks, equipment).
- **Timetable Management:** Create and manage school timetables.
- **Notification System:** Send notifications to users regarding important updates.
- **Logbook Management:** Maintain a record of significant events and activities.

- Docker

**DevOps:**
- Docker Compose


## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Docker
- Docker Compose
- TODO: Add any other specific Java version or dependency requirements


### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/thaimy1614/scholarsync.git
   cd scholarsync
   ```

2. **Start the services:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

This will build and start all the microservices defined in `compose.yaml`.

3. **Access Services:**
   TODO: Add instructions on accessing individual services (e.g., API endpoints, web UIs) after determining how each service is exposed.

## ⚙️ Configuration

The application configuration is primarily managed through environment variables within each Docker container defined in `compose.yaml`.  Detailed configuration options for each service require analysis of the individual service codebases.  TODO:  Add details on environment variables used, including crucial ones and their purposes.


## 🧪 Testing

TODO: Add testing information once testing framework and implementation is determined.


## 🚀 Deployment

The application is designed for deployment using Docker Compose. The `compose.yaml` file defines the necessary configurations.  For production deployments, consider using Docker Swarm or Kubernetes for orchestration and scaling.
